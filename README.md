----
Yes — anyone can visit your blog like a normal website if you host it using GitHub Pages. No GitHub account is needed for visitors. It works just like a regular site with a public URL 🌍

Let me break it down cleanly and practically, without hype.


---

What GitHub Pages actually gives you

Free static website hosting

Public URL like:

https://yourusername.github.io

or https://yourusername.github.io/blog-name


Fast, secure (HTTPS by default)

Perfect for blogs, portfolios, documentation


Limitations (important to be honest):

Static only (no backend, no database)

Comments need third-party tools (Disqus, Giscus, etc.)

Best ways to post a blog on GitHub (choose based on effort)

Option 1: Easiest — Markdown blog using Jekyll (recommended)

This is what GitHub Pages is designed for.

Why this is good

You write blogs in Markdown (simple, clean)

Automatic blog structure (posts, dates, categories)

Tons of free themes

Zero hosting config


How to do it (step-by-step)

1. Create a GitHub account (if you don’t have one)


2. Create a new repository

Repo name:

yourusername.github.io

Must be public



3. Enable GitHub Pages

Go to Settings → Pages

Source: Deploy from a branch

Branch: main

Folder: /root



4. Pick a theme (fastest start)

Settings → Pages → Theme chooser
OR

Use a ready-made Jekyll theme repo and fork it



5. Create blog posts

Create a folder: _posts

File name format (important):

2026-02-07-my-first-blog.md

Example content:

---
layout: post
title: "My First Blog"
date: 2026-02-07
---

This is my first blog hosted on GitHub Pages 🚀



6. Commit & push

Within 1–2 minutes, your blog is live 🎉





---

Option 2: Very simple — HTML only

If you don’t want Markdown or Jekyll.

Create index.html

Write plain HTML/CSS

Push to repo

Site goes live


Downside:

No blog system

You manually manage every post



---

Option 3: Professional setup — Hugo / Gatsby / Astro

Best if you want:

Fast performance

SEO control

Clean URLs

Modern dev experience


But:

Slight learning curve

Build step required


For first blog → overkill


---

Can people really visit it like a normal blog?

Yes. 100%.

Google can index it

Shareable links

Works on mobile

Looks like any WordPress/Medium site if themed well


Many tech blogs, company docs, and personal sites use GitHub Pages.


---

What I’d recommend for you

Given your background (you like structured, clean solutions):

👉 Start with GitHub Pages + Jekyll theme

Minimal effort

Clean writing flow

Easy to maintain

Scales well later


If you want, I can:

Recommend good blog themes

Create a ready-to-use repo structure

Help you write your first blog post

Show how to add comments, analytics, custom domain


Just tell me:

1. Do you want tech blogs, personal writing, or both?


2. Do you want it minimal or fancy?
